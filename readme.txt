== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How call myList's button? =

There are two ways by your needs:

1. by Shortcode
if you needs a single button in a page or post or product sheet, just write 

`[show_gd_mylist_btn]`

in the content

2. by code into theme
if you needs to put the buttom in themes code, just write 

`
<?php
$arg = array (
	'echo' => true
);
do_action('gd_mylist_btn',$arg); 
?>
`

where do you want that button will show it

= How call myList's list? =

yuo can show MyList list by shortcode, just create a page (eg: myList) and put into the content the shortcode

`[show_gd_mylist_list]`

if you want disable the share button

`
[show_gd_mylist_list share_list='no']
`

= How change login permission? =

Change the value on row #20 of file  `wp-content/plugins/gd-mylist/gd-mylist.php` the value is `no` **by default**

`from:
	'login_request' => 'no',
to:
	'login_request' => 'yes',
`

Note

In case the user has not logged, the user's id data will be storage in a cookie by GD-Mylist. 

So if the same user made two different wish lists, one before and one after he has logged, the MyList List will be like as new user, because for the plugin the user appears as two different users.

= Can I Template customization? =

Yes, there are different templates in html format, you can find it in "template" folder `wp-content/plugins/gd-mylist/template/...`.
If you want, you can create a new one in different directory just copy **all files** and **change the path** into `gd-mylist-code.php` file variable `$template_path`.
Templates files are:

1. Add MyList button:
	* btn-add.php
	* chunck-add.php (it'll appare just after first click)

2. Remove MyList button:
	* btn-remove.php
	* chunck-remove.php (it'll appare just after first click)

3. Loading status (it'll appare just after first click)
	* chunck-loading.php

4. Add MyList button if you not login
	* btn-login.php (there is a javascript alert)

5. MyList list
	* box-list.php (where there are some items to show)
	* box-list-empty.php (when there list is empty)
	* box-list-share.php (for share button)

= Icon customization =

I use **Font Awesome** as icon framework [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/ "Font Awesome"), so can change with one of that, just cange call name into templets

= CSS Class =

I use **Bootstrap 3** html and css syntax to create html templates [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/ "Bootstrap"), but you can change with your framework

= Values =

Every templates has simple syntax to target variables, variables list in deep:

* Button Template (all are required)
	* ##itemID##
	* ##TARGET##
	* ##NONCE##
	* ##userID##
	* class="btn-gd-remove-mylist" (to remove button)
	* class="btn-gd-add-mylist" (to add button)

Minimal **button** html syntax (eg: remove button):

`<a href="javascript:void();" class="btn-gd-remove-mylist" id="mylist-##itemID##" data-postid="##itemID##" data-styletarget="##TARGET##" data-userid="##userID##" data-nonce="##NONCE##">remove My List</a>`

	* ##postAuthorName##
	* ##postContent##
	* ##postBtn##
	* ##pageID##
	* ##userID##
	* class="gd-mylist-box" (required)

Minial **list** html syntax:

`<p class="gd-mylist-box"><a href="##postUrl##">##postTitle##</a> ##postBtn##</p>`
